 Challenge Description:
```
You've been so helpful lately, and that was very good work you did. Yes, I'm going to put it right here, on the refrigerator, very good job indeed. You're the perfect person to help me with another issue that come up. One of our lab researchers has mysteriously disappeared. He was working on the prototype for a hashing IP block that worked very much like, but not identically to, the common Blake2 hash family. Last we heard from him, he was working on the testbenches for the unit. One of his labmates swears she knew of a secret message that could be extracted with the testbenches, but she couldn't quite recall how to trigger it. Maybe you could help?

This one seemed hard... until I used the most recent chatgpt model `o1`.

This solved the challenge in seconds, rather than minutes. My head was spinning once I switched tabs back, and saw the solution. Might as well give the link rather than take credit myself.
