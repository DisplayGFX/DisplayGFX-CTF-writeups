# Intro
This is my repo where I upload the writeups to the challenges I notice are retired or sufficiently old (If not HTB)
# Employers
If you were linked to this repo, please reach out to me on here, twitter at @DisplayGFXSec, or on Discord at @displaygfx. I will confirm or deny if you ask me if the Person who gave you a link to this is in fact me. Please do not ask me for my name, as I will not give it to you, and probably block you shortly thereafter. I practice OPSEC, and I dont give out my real name for good reasons, none of which are illegal. Doxxing is real, and very bad.
# Will I have the flags in the writeups.
No. I will instead link to a page that proves that I solved the challenge. If I decide to upload active challenges, they will be protected by the flag. If it is not HackTheBox, I will simply not include the flag, as you are not entitled to proof. The writeup should be enough.
# Credits
I would like to thank @X41, @flareon42, Kevin Thomas, @AdmiralPotato and the DC540 group for giving me the spaces to learn how to do this kind of stuff, and Reverse
Engineering in particular. I would still be cluelessly poking around ghidra without all of your help.
